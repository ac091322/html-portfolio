<h1>Alan's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Here goes my top movies of all time...</h2>
<hr />
<h3>#1 - Fight Club</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time because of the twist at the end. When Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the same character, I totally didn't see that comingh!</p>
<h3>#2 - Romeo & Juliet</h3>
<p>I like this movie because it took an old classic and put it into a modern setting.</p>
<p>Plus the soundtrack was amazing.</p>
<h3>#3 - Snatch</h3>
<p>
This moving was great because of the following 3 reasons:<br />
1. It had an amazing cast.<br />
2. It was humorous.<br />
3. Everythign came together perfectly at the end.<br />
