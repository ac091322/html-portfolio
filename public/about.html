<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alan Chang. I grew up in the Bay Area and moved to China right after college in 2007. I lived in China for 16 years and came back in September 2022.</p>

<p>I worked as a localization specialist in the translation industry. But recently I decided to have a career change. Now I'm learning software engineering.</p>

<p>I've always been looking to find the balance between something new and exciting versus something safe and stable. But in a world brimming with more uncertainty than any past decade, anchoring myself to something steady and reliable seems to be outweighing everything else.</p>
